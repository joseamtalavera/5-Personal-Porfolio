Sure, I'll explain this JavaScript code step by step:

const timeContainer = document.getElementById("time-container");: This line of code retrieves the element with the ID "time-container" from the DOM and stores it in a constant variable called timeContainer. This element is where the calculated difference between the current time and the birthdate will be displayed.

const BIRTH_DAY = "12-10-1815";: This line of code creates a constant variable called BIRTH_DAY and assigns it the value of a birthdate in the format "MM-DD-YYYY".

const BIRTH_DAY_DATE = new Date(BIRTH_DAY);: This line of code creates a constant variable called BIRTH_DAY_DATE and assigns it the value of a new Date object, created by passing in the BIRTH_DAY variable as an argument. This allows us to work with the birthdate as a date object.

const intlNumberFormatter = new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US");: This line of code creates a constant variable called intlNumberFormatter and assigns it the value of a new Intl.NumberFormat object, with the locale set to "en-US". This object will be used to format the difference between the current time and the birthdate as a number with commas.

setInterval(() => {...}, 1000);: This line of code uses the setInterval() function to repeatedly execute the code inside the curly braces every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). This will update the displayed difference every second.

const now = new Date();: This line of code creates a constant variable called now and assigns it the value of a new Date object, which represents the current date and time.

const difference = Math.floor((now.getTime() - BIRTH_DAY_DATE.getTime()) / 1000);: This line of code calculates the difference between the current time and the birthdate, in seconds, and stores it in a constant variable called difference. The Math.floor() function is used to round down the result to the nearest whole number.

timeContainer.innerText = intlNumberFormatter.format(difference);: This line of code sets the innerText property of the timeContainer element to the formatted value of difference, using the intlNumberFormatter object to format the number with commas.

So, in summary, this code calculates and displays the difference in seconds between a birthdate and the current time, formatted with commas using an Intl.NumberFormat object, and updates every second using setInterval().
